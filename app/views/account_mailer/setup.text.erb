Hi there!

After several weeks of work I am very excited to announce the release of the all new Simple Gift List. Not much has changed on the outside, but under the hood the site is brand new. We've also moved, Gift List is now at:

http://simplegiftlist.com

All of your old lists have been migrated so you can pick up right where you left off. You will have to enter a new password to continue gifting. To setup your account visit this url below:

<%= setup_account_url(:key => @user.perishable_token) %>

Any questions feel free to email me (jordan.byron@gmail.com).

Happy Gifting!
